## The teleportation temple dungeon:

5 puzzles

1. is dead simple, you just shoot at the target block over the lamp.
   - It also unlocks another room somewhere.

2. there's a bunch of levers with numbers all around the place. All of them have the same 2 numbers on them. `5` and `17`.
   - When all of them are placed on the same number, the corresponding room opens.
   - There's also a button marked `17` in the hall on the left. It also needs to be pressed.

3. kill the boss.
   - Pretty straightforward. After killing him, the lamp will light up.
   - After killing the boss, you'll hear a sound and the lamp will light up.

4. is on the right, behind the door marked with `5`. You can get there after defeating the boss.
   - **what is it?**

5. requires you to get the 2 keys to enter the room behind the big locked door. there is something to activate it there.
   - One key you get from the rooms behind the door marked with `5`.
   - One key is hidden somewhere in plain sight.

There's also a bunch of other rooms and places that have no puzzles in them.

play-through:

- shoot the lamp [1]
- kill the boss, lamp [3]
- toggle the lever behind door `5`, lamp [4]
- enter the room with 2 levers, lamp [5]
- flip the final lever in that room, lamp [2] magic barrier blocking the way disappears.


After all the lamps are lit up:
- Play a sound
- Create a holographic (stained glass?) extension to the bridge, connecting it to somewhere so you can cross.
- Spawn some mobs on the bridge itself
- The cages in the walls light up with lava
- More lava flows from the ceiling

You can't turn the lamps off afterwards.
