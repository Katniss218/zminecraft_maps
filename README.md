# zminecraft_terrains
An archive of various (mostly adventure) maps for Minecraft.

Painted using WorldPainter (trees and stuff won't work unless you also have the pack).

"___INTACT" means that the map is in its original condition, without any errors/glitches and all the original data can be retrieved, given you have access to the original version of Minecraft or are willing to use external tools. It doesn't necessarily mean that retrieval will be easy. It just means that no data corruption or modification has been done.
