# Traps
Traps are generally considered things that happen suddenly and without warning, or with very little warning.

In a broader meaning, they can be considered to also be "looming" ominous parts of the scenery, for the player to fear.

## Traps:

- Block disappears and lava flows out.

**Mobs suddenly appear**

**Fireball barrage**

Dodging fireballs/etc.

Barricaded door made of blocks you can remove. After you remove the barricade, the door shatters in an explosion and a strong enemy appears on the other side.
on the other side can be a cave or something.

Spawner that you can destroy with your pickaxe. Mobs punching you around will make it harder.
